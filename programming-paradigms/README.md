# Programming Paradigms
- It's about "How you write/organize your code".
  
JavaScript supports multiple programming styles, including:
1. **Procedural Programming**: 
   - Write sequential series of execution steps/tasks
   - *Top to bottom* code execution
2. **Functional Programming**
   - Organize code in (pure) functions with clearly defined tasks
   - Pass data around via parameters
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**
   - Organize data and logic in objects (properties + methods)
   - Organize code in logical entities
